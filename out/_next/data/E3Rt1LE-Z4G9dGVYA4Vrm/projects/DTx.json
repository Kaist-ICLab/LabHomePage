As with traditional therapeutics, DTx also requires clinical validation of efficacy through systematic clinical trials. The US FDA has already authorized a number of DTx products, for example, WellDoc's BlueStar for diabetes management, and Pear Therapeutics' reSET for drug addiction recovery, opening up new DTx possibilities, such as doctors' prescriptions and insurance reimbursement. Unlike traditional drug development, the cost of DTx development is relatively low, and new DTx markets are growing rapidly. The DTx market is estimated to increase to $8.7 billion in 2025, with an average annual growth rate of 20% (GrandView 2017).\"}),(0,i.jsx)(a.p,{children:\"DTx therapies mostly consider behavioral changes in chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g., depression, sleep disorders, and ADHD).

DTx aims to induce behavioral changes in users, and it is very important to analyze patient DTx engagement and receptivity to shorten the DTx development time and to maximize the effectiveness of DTx. This project aims to investigate the user engagement and intervention receptivity to DTx by analyzing digital footprint data (known as digital phenotype data) collected from mobile and wearable devices. Data-driven DTx analytics for user engagement and intervention receptivity in DTx delivery systems will provide key insights for the improvements of DTx, possibly innovating the existing paradigm of DTx development processes.\"})]})}}var D=x;return T;})();\n;return Component;",
