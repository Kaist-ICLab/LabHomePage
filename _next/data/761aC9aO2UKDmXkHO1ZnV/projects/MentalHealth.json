The rate of depression risk group was 22.8%, which was about 6 times higher than 3.8% in 2018, before COVID-19, and the rate of suicidal thoughts was 16.3%, which is about 3.5 times higher than 4.7% in 2018. In particular, the proportion of those in their 20s and 30s at risk for depression was 30.0% and 30.5%, respectively, more than twice that of those in their 60s, indicating that young people are more negatively affected by COVID-19.

Early intervention and proactive management of mental illness can improve the quality of life of patients as well as significantly reduce socioeconomic costs.

Currently, the Gold Standard for Mental Health Diagnosis is \\u201CDSM-5\\u201D (Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Ed) (APA, 2013). Since DSM-5 mainly uses behavioral routines, our goal is to leverage the data collected from mobile and wearable devices to extract behavioral routines for clinical diagnosis (e.g., making a phone call or responding to a received message). We expect that data-driven routine modeling and visualization helps to overcome the limitations of traditional self-report based DSM-5 diagnoses and provide new foundations for enabling proactive intervention services in everyday contexts.\"})]})}}var w=b;return x;})();\n;return Component;","toc":[],"frontMatter":{"readingTime":{"text":"3 min read","minutes":2.27,"time":136200,"words":454},"slug":"MentalHealth","fileName":"MentalHealth.md","title":"Mental Health Inference and Intervention with Mobile and Wearable Computing","publications":["lee2019intelligent","choi2019multi","lee2021systematic","lee2022understanding"],"participated":["HansooLee","PanyuZhang","YugyeongJung","HyunsooLee","HeiYiuLaw"],"image":"/static/images/projects/DigitalHealth.jpg","status":"Ongoing","date":null}}},"__N_SSG":true}
