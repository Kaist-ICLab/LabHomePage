### Research Area

Our research area is Human-Computer Interaction(HCI), especially **positive computing**, which aims to support well-being and human potential.

Using computing capabilities(e.g. smartphones, wearables, IoT devices), we try to better understand and address threats to human well-being ranging from technology dependence(e.g. addiction, productivity loss, technostress) to mental/physical/social health problem(e.g. stress, lack of physical activity, social isolation).

As HCI researchers, we are well aware of such threats to usersâ€™ well-being and have always wished to make not only scholarly contributions but also societal impact by making our research findings available to those in need.
