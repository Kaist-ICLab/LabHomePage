### Research Area

Our research area is Human-Computer Interaction(HCI), especially **positive computing**, which aims to support well-being and human potential.

Using computing capabilities(e.g. smartphones, wearables, IoT devices), we try to better understand and address threats to human well-being ranging from technology dependence(e.g. addiction, productivity loss, technostress) to mental/physical/social health problem(e.g. stress, lack of physical activity, social isolation).

As HCI researchers, we are well aware of such threats to usersâ€™ well-being and have always wished to make not only scholarly contributions but also societal impact by making our research findings available to those in need.

Our research methods include analyzing multiple data sources ranging from sensor data to interaction data to understand user needs and find systems design implications, and building/deploying novel ubiquitous and social computing systems.
