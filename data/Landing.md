## Welcome to Interactive Computing Lab!

KAIST Interactive Computing Lab’s major research area is positive computing, which aims to use computing technologies to support wellbeing and human potential. In particular, we focused on leveraging ubiquitous computing technologies that have sensing, networking, and computing capability (e.g., smartphones, wearables, and Internet of Things) to better understand and deal with threats to the well-being of users, ranging from technology dependence (e.g., addiction, productivity loss, technostress) to mental/physical/social problems (e.g., lack of physical activity, social isolation, and depression).

We as researchers in the HCI field, are well aware of such threats to users’ well-being and have always wanted to make not only scholarly contributions but also societal impact by making our research outcomes accessible to the people who are in need. For this reason, the major research efforts undertaken by us have been on designing, building, and evaluating novel positive computing systems that help improve productivity and physical activity using interactive technologies.
